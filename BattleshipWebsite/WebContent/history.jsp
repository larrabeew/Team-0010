		<img src="assets/images/history/allie.jpg" alt="Allied leaders" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p>Consisted of the United States, Great Britain, France, (resistance groups within) Poland, and later on in the war Italy and Russia.</p>
	
		<h2 id="hist">Axis</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/history/axi.jpg" alt="Axis Forces during Munich Agreement" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p>Consisted of Germany, Russia (for a time), Japan, and Italy early on in the war.<p>
	
	
		<h2 id="hist">Americans</h2> 
		<img src="assets/images/history/amer.jpg" alt="American Flag Raising on Iwo Jima" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p>Wanted initially to remain neutral in the war, America at the time was seen as a dominant super power much like today and both sides eagerly wanted
		America to become involved with their side. It wasn't until December 7, 1941 when the Japanese bombed Pearl harbor that the United States, the following day, 
		joined the struggle on the Allies' side. This was the great tipping point of the war, as the outcry from America was heard far and wide, and they were relentless
		against Axis forces.</p>
	
	
		<h2 id="hist">British</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/history/brit.jpg" alt="Bernard Montgomery British Officer" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p> Was one of the other major super powers of the time, was one of the first countries to declare war on Germany, and until the United States
		joined the fight they were one of the last major free countries fighting against the Nazi's. At the time too, they had one of the world's bigest navy forces
		which made them the target of German forces.</p>
	
	
		<h2 id="hist">French</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/history/fren.jpg" alt="French Battleship Courbet" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p> Part of the Allies, they were invaded by Hitler's forces in 1940, and on May 10, 1940,
		 France was defeated and officially occupied until the year 1944.</p>
	
	
	
		<h2 id="hist">Germans/Nazis</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/history/naz.jpg" alt="Hitler and the German people" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p> Lead by Adolf Hitler, the Germans at the time of WWII were still recovering a great deal from the first World War, which is how Hitler was able
		to rise to power, through empty promises to bring the still defeated German people up out of the muck and into many riches and splendor. On May 2, 1945 Allied
		forces had reached, and defeated German forces in Berlin, and the war in Europe was finally over.</p>
	
	
		<h2 id="hist">Russians/Soviets</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/history/sov.jpg" alt="Soviet Pendant" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p>Initially allied to Nazi Germany, lead by Joseph Stalin him and Hitler agreed to divide Poland in half and split it, and they were allied up until
		Hitler decided to betray Stalin and invade Russia. However, Nazi troops were ill equipped for the Russian winters, and were thus driven from the Soviet Union and
		Stalin joined the Allied Forces.</p>
	
	
		<h2 id="hist">Japanese</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/history/jap.jpg" alt="Japanese Battleship Nagato" height="450px" width="700px"> 
		<p>Part of Axis forces, the Japanese were relentless in their attacks, and were the last of the Axis forces to surrender, even after Germany surrendered to the Allies.
		They did not surrender until America dropped two atomic bombs on two major cities, Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki August 9, 1945.</p>
