	<h1>Allies</h1>
	<p>Consisted of the United States, Great Britain, France, (resistance groups within) Poland, and later on in the war Italy and Russia.</p>

	<h1>Axis</h1>
	<p>Consisted of Germany, Russia (for a time), Japan, and Italy early on in the war.<p>


	<h1>Americans</h1> 
	<p>Wanted initially to remain neutral in the war, America at the time was seen as a dominant super power much like today and both sides eagerly wanted
	America to become involved with their side. It wasn't until December 7, 1941 when the Japanese bombed Pearl harbor that the United States, the following day, 
	joined the struggle on the Allies' side. This was the great tipping point of the war, as the outcry from America was heard far and wide, and they were relentless
	against Axis forces.</p>


	<h1>British</h1>
	<p> Was one of the other major super powers of the time, was one of the first countries to declare war on Germany, and until the United States
	joined the fight they were one of the last major free countries fighting against the Nazi's. At the time too, they had one of the world's bigest navy forces
	which made them the target of German forces.</p>


	<h1>French</h1>
	<p> Part of the Allies, they were invaded by Hitler's forces in 1940, and on May 10, 1940,
	 France was defeated and officially occupied until the year 1944.</p>



	<h1>Germans/Nazis</h1>
	<p> Lead by Adolf Hitler, the Germans at the time of WWII were still recovering a great deal from the first World War, which is how Hitler was able
	to rise to power, through empty promises to bring the still defeated German people up out of the muck and into many riches and splendor. On May 2, 1945 Allied
	forces had reached, and defeated German forces in Berlin, and the war in Europe was finally over.</p>


	<h1>Russians/Soviets</h1>
	<p>Initially allied to Nazi Germany, lead by Joseph Stalin him and Hitler agreed to divide Poland in half and split it, and they were allied up until
	Hitler decided to betray Stalin and invade Russia. However, Nazi troops were ill equipped for the Russian winters, and were thus driven from the Soviet Union and
	Stalin joined the Allied Forces.</p>


Japanese - Part of Axis forces, the Japanese were relentless in their attacks, and were the last of the Axis forces to surrender, even after Germany surrendered to the Allies.
They did not surrender until America dropped two atomic bombs on two major cities, Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki August 9, 1945.
