					<h2>The Goal</h2>
					<p>
						Six students of CVTC set out to build a simulation of the classic game Battleship. This project was
						part of a larger assignment to learn the Agile programming development pattern. They also in this 
						process learned Git as well as other development software. After learning the basic concepts the 
						students had about five weeks to complete this product.
					</p>

					<h2>The Product</h2>
					<p>
						This product, as stated above, is a simulation of the classic game by Milton-Bradley "Battleship".
						There were a lot of goals at the outset of this project but given the limited time due to the 
						length of the class that all of the potential features are added. At its most basic this program will
						allow its users to play the table top game Battleship against either users or the computer.
					</p>

					<h2>The Class</h2>
					<p>
						The course that these students are enrolled in is "Agile w/ Design Patterns". The first two weeks 
						were focused on learning the Agile process. The next week was learning the basics of Git. The rest of
						the course was devoted to working with your team on building your product now equipped with what you
						had learned earlier in the class.
